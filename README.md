# Machine-Learning-CNN-Traffic-Sign-Classifier

- The main goal of this project is to learn Keras and Convoluted Neural Network including back-propogation, pooling and dropout.  
- Model is designed to recognize and classify traffic signs.  
- This model can be further used in automated driving cars.  
- Dataset is taken from The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark. http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset.  
- For loading and precossing of images, code is adopted from https://chsasank.github.io/keras-tutorial.html.  
- Used Amazon Web Services because of massive computations involved.
